*** Description ***
A game similar to the electronic Simon game.  The program will give a sequence displaying visuals and outputting audio to be repeated by the user. It will be done using a GUI in C++ with multiple buttons, each with different symbols and sounds associated to it. The program will start with a simple, small sequence to be repeated. To repeat the sequence of the program, the user must select the correct buttons in the correct order. If the entire sequence is entered correctly by the user, the program will output a new sequence and the user’s score will be incremented. As the user continues to respond correctly, the sequences will gradually get longer and more difficult. If at any point the input is entered incorrectly, the program will halt and a losing message will be displayed with the player’s score, followed by an option to play again.
